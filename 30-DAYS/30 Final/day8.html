            <h1>Why Keep Changing Your Wi-Fi password is important</h1>
            <p>Your home Wi-Fi network is the gateway to your personal data and devices. Securing it properly is crucial to avoid unauthorized access, data theft, and hacking attempts. One of the most effective ways to secure your Wi-Fi is by regularly changing your password and ensuring the strongest encryption standard, WPA3, is enabled (if supported by your router).</p>

            <h2>Real-Life Example: KRACK Attack on WPA2</h2>
            <p> In 2017, the KRACK attack exposed a serious vulnerability in the WPA2 encryption protocol, which is widely used in Wi-Fi networks. Hackers could exploit this flaw to eavesdrop on communication between devices and Wi-Fi routers, potentially stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers, passwords, and more. This incident underscored the importance of upgrading to stronger encryption methods, such as WPA3, to protect against future vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>This led to many users manually removing these apps, and several tutorials and software programs were developed to help people clean their systems. It highlighted the importance of debloating and the consequences of bloated systems on both user experience and security.</p>

            <h2>Risks of Not Changing Your Wi-Fi Password and Using Outdated Encryption</h2>
            <p>Failing to update wi-fi passwords leads to several risks, including:</p>
            <div class="list">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Increased Vulnerability:</b> Using outdated encryption methods like WEP or WPA2 makes your network easier to hack, exposing your personal data.</li>
                    <li><b>Network Abuse: </b>Unauthorized users could leech your Wi-Fi bandwidth, slowing down your internet and increasing the risk of illegal activities being traced back to your network.</li>
                    <li><b>Device Security Risk:</b> If a hacker gains access to your Wi-Fi, they can potentially attack your smart devices (e.g., security cameras, smart TVs) or infect your devices with malware.</li>

                    </label>
                    <div class="instruction-content" style="display: none;">
                        <p><b>Challenge:</b>You need to access your router's admin panel. Most routers require you to enter a specific IP address in your web browser (usually something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).</p>
                        <p><b>Tip:</b>Check your router’s manual or the label on the router itself for the correct IP address and login credentials (username and password).

                        <p><b>Challenge:</b>Once you log in, find the section that manages your wireless settings. This is often labeled as Wireless, Wi-Fi Settings, or Security.</p>
                        <p><b>Tip:</b>If your router has both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, you may need to change the password and encryption for each band separately.</p>

                        <p><b>Tip:</b>Choose a strong password with at least 12 characters, mixing upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information like your name or birthdate.</p>

                        <p><b>Challenge:</b>In the security settings, you will see an option for encryption methods. Look for WPA3 in the drop-down menu. If WPA3 is not supported, choose WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode, which allows older devices to connect while using WPA3 for newer devices.</p>
                        <p><b>Tip:</b>If your router does not support WPA3, consider updating its firmware or purchasing a router that supports WPA3 for future-proof security.</p>
